# ExtensionScript
Admin manager script for Tekno MW3. All done via Rcon.
Put Extension.js in your IW4M Plugins folder to make use of this script. Or else, you can use the command ```!rcon set sv_b3Execute !commandname args``` to execute the commands.
Not all commands work that's why Extension.js doesn't contain all the commands described in the script, I will update it when they do work.
You must use this version of IS: [InfinityScript](https://github.com/diamante0018/InfinityScript)
It is also shipped with every release of this script.
